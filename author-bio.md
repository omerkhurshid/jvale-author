# J. Vale - Author Bio

Born beneath the shadow of ancient mountains where mist clings to forgotten ruins, J. Vale spent their formative years wandering through libraries older than memory and streets that whisper of untold stories. Growing up in a place where reality blurs at the edges—where morning fog might reveal glimpses of other worlds and midnight bells echo with meanings beyond sound—shaped their unique voice in fantasy literature.

The peculiar nature of their hometown, with its ever-shifting architecture and residents who speak in riddles, instilled in Vale a deep fascination with the spaces between worlds. Local legends speak of doors that open only on certain nights and books that write themselves in the old quarter's dusty shops—experiences that would later breathe life into the pages of The Veilbound Saga.

When not crafting tales of moonfire and shattered realms, Vale can be found collecting antique keys that open no known locks, studying star charts from civilizations that may never have existed, and conversing with cats who seem to know far more than they should.

Vale's debut novel, "Marked by Moonfire," introduces readers to a world where magic costs more than gold and love might be the most dangerous spell of all. The upcoming "Shattered World: The First Gate" promises to unlock mysteries that some believe are better left sealed.

## A Note from the Author

"I write for those who've felt the pull of another world just beyond the edge of sight, for the dreamers who know that some doors, once opened, can never be closed again. My stories come from the twilight places—neither fully here nor there—where the impossible becomes inevitable."

*J. Vale currently resides wherever the story takes them, accompanied by a suspicious number of notebooks and an ever-growing collection of tea blends from places that don't appear on any map.*
